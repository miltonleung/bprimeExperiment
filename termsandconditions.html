        <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

        <p id="fine">Acceptance of your order is subject to the terms and conditions below and the terms and conditions set out in our order acceptance (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Terms”). The Terms and conditions of the order acceptance will prevail if they conflict with any of the terms and conditions set out below. As used herein, (a) “us”, “we” and “our” each mean BPrime Medical Ltd. and its respective successors and assigns, and (b) “you” and “your” each mean the buyer as identified on the order and its successors and permitted assigns.
            <br /><br />
            The Terms represent the entire agreement between you and us with respect to your purchase. No amendments or waiver of the Terms is valid, unless made in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement of such amendment or waiver is sought. If any part of the Terms is declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalid or unenforceable part will be deemed severed and the remaining Terms will continue in force and all rights and remedies accrued under the valid and enforceable Terms, or part thereof, will survive the declaration.
